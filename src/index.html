          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p class="leading-normal">
            Hello! My name is Tim Sasaki and I’m a licensed clinical social
            worker with over ten years of experience providing mental health
            services in English and Spanish in the Bay Area.
          </p>
          <p class="leading-normal mb-4">
            My background in community mental health has allowed me to work with
            a wide range of identities and populations, including: severely
            emotionally disturbed children, adults with severe mental illness,
            transitional age LGBTQ youth, immigrants, gay and lesbian adults,
            transgender and nonbinary adults, and many identities in between.
          </p>
          <p class="leading-normal mb-4">
            I help individuals work through challenges like depression, anxiety,
            life transitions, work stress, relationships, grief and loss, severe
            mental illness, substance use and addiction, trauma, gender
            transition, coming out, aging, multiple minority stress, aging in
            the queer community, and issues related to immigration.
          </p>
          <p class="leading-normal">
            I hold master’s degrees in Social Welfare and Public Health from the
            University of California Berkeley, and I completed my bachelor’s
            degree at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. I am a member of the
            National Association of Social Work, Psychologytoday, and I serve on
            the Steering Committee for the Coalition of Clinical Social Work at
            the San Francisco Center for Psychoanalysis.

            I provide individual psychotherapy and pre-surgical assessment for
            gender affirming surgeries at my office in the Mission District of
            San Francisco, California.

              <p class="mb-3">Individual Psychotherapy</p>
              <p>
                I believe the power of therapy lies in improving your
                relationship to the world, the people close to you, and
                ultimately to yourself. My approach to therapy is
                trauma-informed and grounded in psychodynamic and psychoanalytic
                training. I also use techniques from cognitive behavioral
                therapy, dialectical behavioral therapy, motivational
                interviewing, gender affirming therapy, harm reduction, and
                mindfulness. I welcome any questions you might have about my
                approach to therapy.

                Pre-Surgical Assessment for Gender Affirming Surgery
              </p>
              <p>
                I am committed to ensuring the assessment process is
                collaborative, transparent, and guided by your narrative. I have
                written over 50 assessments (“letters”) for adults pursuing
                gender affirming surgery. If you are in need of a letter or are
                thinking about surgery, please feel free to contact me so we can
                talk more about what to expect of the process.
